Note that incomplete recordings or ones with no location information will not be eligible for upload. Tap the <span class="accent">Upload </span>button, confirm that you wish to upload your recording, then enter your name (or a pseudonym) when prompted. Your recording will then be uploaded to johncage.org. Shortly after that, you should be able to find it on the map of the <span class="accent">World of 4'33&quot;</span> screen (see below).</p>

                         <p>A set of playback information and controls are displayed at the bottom of the screen after the first selection is made.
